# Linked List With Integers

Wanted to remediate after C++ class about objects stored on the heap and linked lists.

-Takes in user input of integers

-After -1 is entered, prints the node list

-Uses bubble sort to swap pointers around

-Prints node list again

May work more on it for a robust linked list system that can handle any kind of object.
